Everyone needs a little love.

## Assignment

Build a dating application which matches users based on their responses to a series of qualifying questions (e.g. "How much do you like grilled cheese sandwiches?"). The app should allow the following behaviors:

* Users can create accounts with basic information about themselves (there is no login system right now)
* Users can answer questions with multiple-choice responses either when creating their accounts or at any time thereafter. Bonus: Have the user rank the "importance" that their potential partner also answered the same way so some questions will have a higher weight than others.
* A user can display the feed of other users, ranked by the number of overlapping responses.
* Add additional features as desired...
  - Maybe users can send messages to each other
  - Maybe users can propose new questions
  - Maybe users can "like" someone and it's only a match if they are liked back.



## Requirements
Upon implementation, ensure that you have included at least one instance of each of the following new concepts:

| Feature | Implementation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collection forms | dropdowns | complete |
| Nested forms | user & profile at once | complete |
| Self-referencing associations | "interested" in a user | complete |
